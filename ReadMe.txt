Ghost type attacks take advantage of Special Attack stat instead of Attack stat. (Im not sure if this counts as a bug but for me it seems weird that Ghost type attacks were physical instead of special, so i changed it.)

Moon ball and Fast ball work as intended now.

Status ailments increase a pokemon's catch rate as they should.
